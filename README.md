# React Development Portfolio

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my progress through Jonas Schmedtmann's ["The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=CM251221G2). It is designed to demonstrate the evolution of my technical proficiency and my avility to implement modern front-end solutions.

## Repository Structure

**[00-Challenges:](/00-challenges/)** This directory contains a series of independent challenge projects featured throughout the programme. Each folder within this section represents a specific problem-solving exercise, showcasing my personal methodology and logic in arriving at the final result.
<br><br>
**[Course Projects & Modules:](/)** The remaining directories follow the core curriculum of the course. These folders document my progress through the primary wealkthrough tutorials and in-depth technical lectures, covering the fundamental and advanced aspects of the React ecosystem.

## Deployment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Technology Used

This portfolio serves as a testament to my learning journey with the React framework. Throughout this project, you will encounter the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Starter templates have been provided at various stages of the course, primarily focusing on custom CSS and example data. As I progress further, I will elaborate on additional technologies and tools utilized in this portfolio.

### AI Use

AI tools have been utilized to enhance documentation quality and identify well-hidden syntax errors within the code, ensuring professional presentation and technical accuracy throughout this portfolio.
