# Challenge: Developer Card

### Objective

Build a reusable developer card component to display developer profiles with images, skills, and skill-level indicators. Apply styling and emoji-based visual cues to differentiate skill proficiency levels.

### Key Technical Learnings

- **Component Architecture & Props** - Breaking down UI into reusable components and passing data through props

- **Array Methods & Dynamic Rendering** - Using `map()` to dynamically render lists of components with unique keys

- **Conditional Rendering & CSS Classes** - Implementing conditional UI display and dynamic styling based on data

### My Approach

- **Data-First Design** - Structured data schema first, then built components around it to facilitate easy addition of multiple developer cards.

- **Component Decomposition** - Broke down the card into logical, reusable components following the single responsibility principle.

- **Scalable Architecture** - Implemented mapping to handle multiple developers, ensuring extensibility for future additions.

- **Semantic HTML & Accessibility** - Maintained semantic HTML structure to improve accessibility and code clarity.
