# Challenge: Date Counter

### Objective

Improve on the previous interactive date counter, giving the steps functionality a slider input, and allowing the user to reset the application.

### Key Technical Learnings

- **Range Input Integration** - Using HTML range/slider inputs to dynamically adjust step values with real-time feedback

- **Reset Functionality** - Implementing a reset button that restores the application to its initial state

### My Approach

- **Slider Control for Steps** - Replaced button-based step increment with a range input slider, allowing users to smoothly adjust the step value without multiple clicks.

- **Reset Handler** - Created a dedicated reset function that returns both `step` and `count` to their initial values, providing a clean way to restart the counter.
