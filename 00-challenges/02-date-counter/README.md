# Challenge: Date Counter

### Objective

Build an interactive date counter that allows users to adjust step values and count to calculate dates in the past or future. Practice React state management and conditional rendering.

### Key Technical Learnings

- **State Management with useState** - Managing multiple pieces of state (`step` and `count`) and updating them with setter functions

- **Event Handling** - Implementing onClick handlers to increment/decrement values using callback functions

- **Date Manipulation & Conditional Rendering** - Working with JavaScript Date objects and rendering different text based on state values

### My Approach

- **State-Driven Logic** - Designed the component around two key state variables that control all functionality and display logic.

- **Functional Updates** - Used functional state updates with callbacks to ensure reliable state transitions.

- **Conditional Text Display** - Implemented clear conditional logic to provide contextual messages based on count values.

- **Date Calculation** - Leveraged JavaScript's Date object methods to handle date arithmetic and formatting.
