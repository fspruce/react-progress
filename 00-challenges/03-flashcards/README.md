# Challenge: Flashcards

### Objective

Build an interactive flashcard application that displays flashcards with the ability to flip between question and answer. Practice React state management, conditional rendering, and event handling.

### Key Technical Learnings

- **State Management with useState** - Managing selected state for individual flashcards to control which side is displayed

- **Conditional Rendering** - Rendering different content based on the flashcard's selected state (question vs answer)

- **Conditional Styling** - Applying different styles based on state to visually reflect the flashcard's current state

- **Event Handling** - Implementing click handlers to toggle the flashcard's selected state

- **List Rendering & Keys** - Rendering dynamic lists of flashcard components with proper key props

### My Approach

- **State-Driven Display Logic** - Used state to track which side of each flashcard is currently displayed

- **Toggle Functionality** - Implemented click handlers to toggle the selected state and flip between question and answer

- **Conditional Rendering & Styling** - Displayed appropriate content and applied different styles based on the flashcard's state
